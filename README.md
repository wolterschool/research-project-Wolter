Abstract: In this project i will be researching the difference in writing style between young people, within the ages of 20 - 30, and people above the age of 60. the goal is to find a meaningfull difference in the complexity in the writing style between the two groups, i will look at vocabulary, sentence structure and sentence lenght to determine a readability score. This research could be useful for researching cognitive age-related development and could help machine learning determine the age of a person based on their writing style.

Research question: "How does the complexity of written language vary across different age groups?"

Hypothesis: between the two age groups i have selected, the older group will have the lower readablity score as they have more writing experience and a larger vocabulary.

Method: i will select two books in the same genre on the same topic per age group, between 18 and 30 and 60+, from project gutenberg and will perform a readability analysis using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. I will then look for notable differences in the readability scores between the two age groups. Based on that i will perform my analysis.
